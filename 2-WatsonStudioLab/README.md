> IMPORTANT: The most important thing for you right now is to take your time and do not rush through the scripts. Rather, try to understand new concepts and let them sink in. You can do the lab during the workshop but if don't you will be able to finish it later or continue with other labs that you find on the way. This is how any skill is built - by doing. 

# 1. Run AutoAI Experiment on Watson Studio

Prerequisites for this lab are:

- [ ] Existing **IBM Cloud** account 

- [ ] Started instance of **Watson Studio** on your **IBM Cloud** account 

AutoAI in Watson Studio helps you touch the data in many different ways and it's doing it automatically. You just feed the AutoAI with the data and the tool runs for you many experiments, builds many models and uses diffent algorithms and plenty of transormations. Aftewards you know more about your data and know what's possible.

> If you haven't registered to IBM Cloud or haven't started Watson Studio intance, please proceed to Preparation Lab.
